#  Best Sleeping Dogs Tips to Help You Get Into a Betting Den

In Sleeping Dogs, you play the role of undercover cop Wei Shen as you take on the Triads in Hong Kong. The game is set up much like Grand Theft Auto, with various missions to complete, activities to partake in, and items to collect. As with many games in this genre, Sleeping Dogs can be a little overwhelming for new players. That’s why we’ve put together some tips to help you get into a betting den and make some serious cash.

First things first: before you can start making some big bucks, you need to establish yourself as a credible member of the Triad. This means completing some of the early missions and earning favor with your boss. Once you’ve reached this point, it’s time to start thinking about making some money. One of the best ways to make cash in Sleeping Dogs is to bet on cockfights. To get started, head to any betting den and look for the rooster icon on the map. From there, it’s just a matter of placing your bets and watching the fight.

Another great way to make money in Sleeping Dogs is by selling drugs. This can be a little risky if you don’t know what you’re doing, but if you manage to make a successful deal, you can make quite a bit of cash. Just be sure to watch out for the police – they can be particularly aggressive when it comes to drug-related crimes.

Finally, another way to make some serious cash in Sleeping Dogs is by participating in street races. There are numerous race events scattered throughout Hong Kong, and they offer decent payouts for first place finishers. Just be sure to keep an eye out for obstacles and other drivers – accidents happen all too easily in street races.

With these tips in mind, you should have no trouble making some serious cash in Sleeping Dogs. So get out there and start earning!

#  Sleeping Dogs: How to Sneak into a Betting Den

In the video game Sleeping Dogs, you play as undercover cop Wei Shen who is tasked with infiltrating the Sun On Yee Triad. Part of your mission is to track down and take down their illegal gambling operations. In this guide, we will show you how to sneak into a betting den undetected and take out the Triad boss.

The first thing you need to do is find a betting den. They are usually marked on the map with a red poker chip icon. Once you have located one, park your car nearby and get out. You will see several people walking around the outside of the building. Do not try to walk in through the front door - it will be heavily guarded.

Instead, walk around to the back of the building and you will see a small door. This is the entrance to the betting den. Stand next to the door and press Square (PS4) or X (Xbox One) to sneak in. If there are any guards inside, they will see you and you will have to fight them.

Once you are inside, make your way up to the second floor where the Triad boss is gambling. There may be some guards here as well, so be careful. When you reach the second floor, equip your weapon of choice and take out the boss. Once he is dead, leave the betting den and congratulations - you have successfully completed your mission!

Sleeping Dogs is an open world action-adventure game developed by United Front Games and published by Square Enix. It was released on August 14, 2012, for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Microsoft Windows platforms. The game was announced in 2009 as True Crime: Hong Kong. However, after Activision lost the rights to the game, it was renamed Sleeping Dogs.

Set in contemporary Hong Kong, the story follows Wei Shen—a Chinese American police officer who goes undercover to infiltrate the Sun On Yee Triad organization. The gameplay involves traversing the cityscape, completing missions—ranging from melee fights and shooting rivals to racing opponents—and upgrading Shen's skills with experience points.

The game has a 79/100 rating on Metacritic. Some common complaints involve the regenerative health system and a lack of vehicles being able to be stolen and crashed. However, most praise the game for its setting, graphics, fight scenes, voice acting, story (despite being derivative), cars and gunplay. 

Despite mixed reviews overall (although leaning towards positive), Sleeping Dogs was a commercial success; shipping over 3 million copies by February 2014. A sequel titled Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition was announced in October 2014; which bundles all of the game's downloadable content into one release along with improved graphics on current-generation consoles.
