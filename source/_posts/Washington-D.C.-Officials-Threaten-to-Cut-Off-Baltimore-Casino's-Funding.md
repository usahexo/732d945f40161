#  Washington D.C. Officials Threaten to Cut Off Baltimore Casino's Funding

WASHINGTON D.C. - Officials in Washington D.C. are threatening to cut off funding for the Baltimore casino if it does not renegotiate its contract with the city.

The casino, which is operated by MGM Resorts International, is required to pay a "promotion fee" to the city, which is used to promote tourism in Washington D.C. However, the casino has been withholding this fee for the past two years, citing a lack of benefit from the agreement.

Washington D.C.'s Deputy Mayor Kevin Donahue said that the city is "willing to work with the casino" but that it must renegotiate its contract and begin paying the promotion fee "immediately."

A spokesperson for MGM Resorts International said that the company is "disappointed" by Washington D.C.'s stance and that it is "evaluating its options."

#  Maryland Lawmakers Eyeing Major Expansion of Baltimore Casino

A proposal in the Maryland General Assembly would see a huge expansion of the Baltimore casino.

If passed, the bill would allow Caesars Entertainment to add up to 5,000 new slot machines and table games to its existing facility.

The measure is seen as a way to help shore up the state’s budget, as it would generate an estimated $245 million in new revenue.

Representative Eric Bromwell, one of the sponsors of the bill, said that it was important to give residents of Baltimore and Maryland “the best gaming experience possible.”

Critics of the measure argue that it could cannibalize revenue from other casinos in the state and lead to more gambling addiction problems.

Others worry about the impact on traffic and public safety in the already congested area around the casino.
