#  Bayern Munich remain the team to beat in the Bundesliga

The 2017-2018 Bundesliga season is nearing its end, and Bayern Munich have been the runaway leaders from start to finish.

Although they have been pushed all the way by Borussia Dortmund in the title race, Jupp Heynckes’ men have still managed to clinch their sixth consecutive league title with weeks to spare.

And there can be no doubts that Bayern are the team to beat in Germany’s top division – they boast one of the best squads in Europe and have barely been challenged by their rivals this term.

Nevertheless, Dortmund did manage to give them a good run for their money earlier in the season, and it will be interesting to see how they fare next year with new coach Lucien Favre at the helm.

Elsewhere in the Bundesliga, RB Leipzig have secured a Champions League spot for next season while Hoffenheim and Bayer Leverkusen will battle it out in the Europa League play-offs.

The race for relegation is also heating up, with VfB Stuttgart, Hannover 96 and FC Augsburg all currently occupying the bottom three spots.

#  Dortmund and RB Leipzig emerge as contenders for the title

A lot was expected from Bayern Munich this season. Many believed that they would easily retain their Bundesliga crown and make it a record sixth consecutive title win. But the Bavarian side has been surprisingly inconsistent, opening up the title race for other teams to take advantage of. Dortmund and RB Leipzig have emerged as the two biggest contenders for the title, with both clubs currently occupying the top two spots in the table.

Dortmund have been in excellent form this season and are currently on a nine-game winning streak in all competitions. They have been especially impressive in their home games, winning all six of their fixtures at the Signal Iduna Park. Christian Pulisic has been one of their standout players, scoring six goals and providing four assists so far this campaign. The American winger is quickly becoming one of the most sought-after players in Europe and is tipped for a big future at Dortmund.

RB Leipzig have also been impressive this season, with their high-pressing style proving difficult for many teams to deal with. They are currently on a five-game winning streak in the Bundesliga and are just two points behind Dortmund going into the winter break. Timo Werner has been their stand-out player this season, scoring 13 goals and providing four assists in his 19 appearances so far.

Both clubs will be looking to make a strong push for the title in the second half of the season and it is likely to be a close battle between them. Bayern Munich may still have a chance of winning it, but they will need to improve their form if they are to catch up to Dortmund and RB Leipzig.

#  Hannover 96 and VfB Stuttgart pull clear of the relegation battle




Both Hannover 96 and VfB Stuttgart secured crucial wins in the battle against relegation on Saturday. Hannover’s match against Mainz 05 was always going to be a tight affair, but goals from Edgar Prib and Linton Maina either side of the break sealed a 2-0 win for the home side.

The result moves Hannover up to 12th in the Bundesliga table, four points clear of the relegation play-off place. In contrast, Mainz have now dropped into the bottom three and are just two points above 18th-placed VfB Stuttgart.

Stuttgart were made to work hard for their win away at Bayer Leverkusen, but goals from Anastasios Donis and Erik Thommy eventually gave them a 2-1 victory. The result means that Stuttgart are now level on points with 16th-placed Hertha Berlin, but they have a vastly superior goal difference which should see them safe from relegation this season.

#  Borussia Monchengladbach impress in the Europa League

Borussia Monchengladbach impressed in their first match in the Europa League this season, beating Portuguese side Braga 3-0.

The Bundesliga outfit were keen to get off to a good start in Europe, and they did just that with a commanding victory over the Portuguese side.

 Goals from Raffael, Lars Stindl and Thorgan Hazard sealed the win for Gladbach, and they will be looking to build on that victory in their next match against Istanbul BB.

Gladbach are currently third in the Bundesliga table, and they will be looking to make an impression in Europe this season.

#  Bayern Munich further extend title lead with comfortable win

 Bayern Munich extended their lead at the top of the Bundesliga table with a comfortable 3-0 win over 10th placed FC Cologne.

The Bavarian giants have now opened up an eight-point cushion over second-placed RB Leipzig, following Saturday’s victory.

Bayern took the lead in the 16th minute when Thomas Muller headed home from close range, after being found unmarked by a deep cross from David Alaba.

The hosts doubled their advantage in first-half stoppage time, as Robert Lewandowski converted a penalty after being fouled inside the area by Timo Horn.

Cologne were reduced to 10 men in the 66th minute when Jorge Mere was shown a straight red card for his foul on Lewandowski.

Bayern made it 3-0 in the 81st minute, as Kingsley Coman finished off a neat team move to round off the scoring.
