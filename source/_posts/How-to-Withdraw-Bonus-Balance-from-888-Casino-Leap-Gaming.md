#  How to Cash Out Your 888 Casino Leap Gaming Bonus

Leap Gaming is one of the leading software providers to top online casinos, and 888 Casino is one of their flagship properties. Players at 888 Casino can take advantage of a generous Leap Gaming bonus offer to increase their bankrolls and enjoy more gaming action. The key to cashing out this bonus is understanding the terms and conditions associated with it.

The Leap Gaming bonus at 888 Casino consists of two parts. The first part is a deposit match bonus, which awards players a percentage of their deposit value as a bonus credit. The second part is a free spin bonus, which awards players free spins on selected games. Both bonuses must be used within 14 days of being awarded, and they are subject to wagering requirements that must be met before any winnings can be withdrawn.

The deposit match bonus credits players with 100% of their deposit value as a bonus, up to a maximum value of €100. This means that if you deposit €100, you will receive an extra €100 in bonus credit, giving you a total bankroll of €200 to play with. The free spin bonus awards players between 10 and 50 free spins, depending on the game that is played. Note that some games may not be eligible for the free spin bonus offer.

In order to cash out the Leap Gaming Bonus from 888 Casino, you will need to meet the wagering requirements. These require that you place bets totalling 25x the value of your bonus amount before any winnings can be withdrawn. So, for example, if you received a €100 deposit match bonus and £50 in free spins, you would need to place bets totalling £2500 (25x€100) before withdrawing any winnings.

Players have 14 days in which to meet these wagering requirements or else the bonuses will expire and be forfeited. In order to make things easier, we recommend using the progress bar located under the ‘My Bonuses’ tab in your account dashboard to track your progress towards meeting them.

The Leap Gaming Bonus at 888 Casino is an excellent way for players to boost their bankrolls and enjoy more gaming action. To cash out your bonus, simply follow the steps outlined above and make sure to meet the wagering requirements within 14 days.

#  What You Need to Know About Withdrawing Your 888 Casino Leap Gaming Bonus

888 Casino Leap Gaming is a new and exciting way to play casino games. When you sign up for an account and make your first deposit, you are automatically given a bonus. The amount of the bonus depends on the amount of your deposit.

The great thing about the 888 Casino Leap Gaming bonus is that it is instantly credited to your account and you can start playing casino games right away. You don't have to wait for the bonus to be processed or for any kind of instructions from customer support.

However, there are some conditions that you need to be aware of before you withdraw your bonus money. The most important condition is that you have to meet the wagering requirements before you can withdraw your money.

The wagering requirements are basically a set of rules that determine how much you need to play before you can cash out your winnings. In most cases, the wagering requirements are 40 times the amount of the bonus. So, if you receive a $100 bonus, you would need to wager $4000 before you could cash out any of your winnings.

Another thing to keep in mind is that not all casino games contribute equally towards meeting the wagering requirements. Slot games, keno, and scratch cards typically contribute 100%, while table games and video poker usually only contribute 10-20%. This means that if you want to meet the wagering requirements as quickly as possible, it's best to stick to those types of games.

You also need to be aware of the expiration date for your bonus. Most bonuses have a validity period of 30 days, after which they will expire and can no longer be used. So, be sure to use them up within that time frame!

In conclusion, withdrawing your 888 Casino Leap Gaming Bonus is not as difficult as it may seem at first glance. Just be sure to familiarize yourself with the wagering requirements and expiration date, and then enjoy playing your favourite casino games!
