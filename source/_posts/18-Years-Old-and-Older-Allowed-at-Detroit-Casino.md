#  18 Years Old and Older Allowed at Detroit Casino

The Motor City Casino in Detroit, Michigan has announced that it will be allowing people who are 18 years old and older to enter the property starting this summer. The casino said that the change is being made in response to customer feedback and will provide guests with a more modern casino experience.

The Motor City Casino is one of three casinos in Detroit, and it has been open since 1999. The property features a variety of gaming options, including 2,000 slot machines, 59 table games, and a 14-table poker room. In addition, the casino offers several restaurants, bars, and clubs.

Detroit is no stranger to gambling. In addition to the three casinos in the city, there are also several Native American casinos located nearby. The MGM Grand Detroit Casino is the largest casino in Michigan and one of the largest in the United States. The property has 3,000 slot machines and 125 table games.

#  Minimum Age for Detroit Casino is 18 Years Old

The Detroit City Council has voted 8-0 to approve an ordinance that sets the minimum age for casino gambling at 18 years old. The move comes as the Detroit casinos prepare to enter into a new market in Ohio, where the minimum age is 21.

Councilman Gabe Leland, who sponsored the ordinance, said that it was important to make sure that Detroit's casinos are operating on a level playing field with their counterparts in Ohio. "We're trying to make sure that we protect our interests here in Detroit," Leland said. "While this may not be a popular decision … we think it's the right thing to do."

Some opponents of the measure argue that it will keep younger people from being able to enjoy gambling in Detroit, but supporters say that it is important to protect people from developing gambling addictions at a young age. "People can gamble when they're older," Leland said. "I'm not trying to stop anyone from doing anything. I'm just trying to make sure that we have some protections in place."

#  No One Younger Than 18 Allowed at Detroit Casino

Michigan’s first casino, MotorCity Casino, in Detroit has a policy that prohibits anyone younger than 18 years old from entering the premises. A security guard at the entrance will ask for identification from anyone who appears to be under the age of 18. The policy is in place to ensure the safety of minors, as casinos can be a place where gambling and alcohol are present.

The casino’s executive director of marketing and communications, Dan Stamper, says that the policy is not new and has been in effect since MotorCity Casino opened its doors in 2007. Stamper also said that the casino receives few complaints about the policy. He added that any minor who is found on the property will be escorted off the property and turned over to their parents or guardians.

The casino is not alone in implementing this type of policy. Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Atlantic City instituted a similar policy in March of 2018. Underage visitors are turned away and not given any refund for their visit.

In Las Vegas, there is no legal drinking age, but casinos have implemented their own rules to prohibit anyone under 21 years old from entering. This rule is strictly enforced by security guards at the entrances of casinos. If someone younger than 21 is caught trying to enter a casino, they will be escorted out of the premises and not given any refund for their visit.

Casinos want to ensure that everyone who visits their property has a safe and enjoyable experience. By implementing policies that prohibit minors from being on the property, casinos are able to provide a safer environment for all guests.

#  You Must be 18 or Older to Enter Detroit Casino

Michigan's Gaming Control and Revenue Act of 1996 stipulates that casino operators must restrict access to their premises to those who are at least 18 years of age. The law is intended to protect Michigan's citizens and visitors from the potential risks associated with gambling, including addiction.

The Detroit Casino is no exception to this rule. Visitors must present a valid photo ID in order to gain access to the casino floor. In addition, the casino employs security personnel who are responsible for ensuring that only those who meet the minimum age requirement are allowed into the premises.

The Detroit Casino is open seven days a week, 24 hours a day. There is something for everyone at this exciting gaming destination, so be sure to visit soon!

#  Detroit Casino Set Minimum Age at 18 Years Old

The Detroit casino has set the minimum age at 18 years old in order to gamble. This is due to the recent decision made by Michigan voters to allow gambling in the state. The Detroit casino is one of many that will be implementing this policy.

Officials for the casino say that they want to ensure that those who are gambling are of legal age and are doing so responsibly. They also want to avoid any potential issues with minors gambling.

Michigan voters passed a ballot measure in November that allows for up to three casinos, including one in Detroit, as well as slot machines at race tracks. The Detroit casino is expected to be one of the most popular casinos in the state and officials wanted to make sure that they had appropriate measures in place before it opened.

The minimum age for gambling at other casinos in the state is 21 years old.
