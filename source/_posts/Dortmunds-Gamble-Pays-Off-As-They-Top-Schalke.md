#  Dortmunds Gamble Pays Off As They Top Schalke

Dortmund were in good form leading into the Revierderby against Schalke, but with only two wins in their last six games, they were still far from being favorites. Things started poorly for Dortmund, as Schalke took the lead in the eighth minute. Ambrozjo Teodorczyk was left unmarked to head in a free kick from Daniel Caligiuri.

Entering halftime down a goal, things didn’t look good for Dortmund. Then, in the 48th minute, Shinji Kagawa equalized with a neat finish from close range. Nine minutes later, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang put Dortmund ahead with a well-placed shot into the bottom corner.

Schalke tried to fight back, but Dortmund held on for the win. The victory puts them four points clear of Schalke in third place and seven points behind leaders Bayern Munich.

The win was not without controversy, however. In stoppage time, referee Felix Zwayer awarded Schalke a penalty after Sokratis Papastathopoulos brought down Daniel Caligiuri inside the area. However, replays showed that the contact took place outside of the area. Penalties have been a thorn in Dortmund’s side all season, as they have now conceded six of them – more than any other team in Europe’s top five leagues.

Despite this costly flaw, Dortmund can be pleased with their performance against Schalke and their current position in the Bundesliga table. With only eight games remaining, they are well on their way to securing a Champions League spot for next season.

#  Champions League Place Still Up For Grabs After Thrilling Match

Manchester City and Liverpool put on a show for the ages at Anfield on Sunday, with the two sides battling to a 3-3 draw that leaves the Premier League title race still very much up in the air.

Liverpool got off to a blistering start, taking a 3-0 lead into halftime courtesy of goals from Mohamed Salah, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, and Sadio Mane. But Man City roared back in the second half, scoring three times in 19 minutes to tie things up and send the match into Extra Time.

In the end, both teams had chances to win it, but neither could find the decisive goal, which means that Liverpool remain two points clear of Man City at the top of the table with two matches remaining.

With just two matches left to play, it's still all to play for in the Premier League title race. Liverpool host Newcastle United next weekend before traveling to Stamford Bridge to take on Chelsea in their final match of the season. Manchester City will travel to Brighton & Hove Albion before finishing their campaign with a home game against Southampton.

It should be an intriguing final few weeks of the season as we see who will be crowned Premier League champions.

#  Tuchel's Tactical Gamble Pays Dividends In Der Klassiker

A tactical gamble by Borussia Dortmund head coach Thomas Tuchel paid dividends as his side emerged 2-1 victors over Bundesliga rivals Bayern Munich in Der Klassiker.

With both teams locked in a title race, the stakes could not have been higher, but it was Dortmund who adapted best to the difficult conditions, playing with a high intensity that caused Bayern problems throughout.

The game's opening goal came midway through the first half via an excellent individual effort from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who beat three defenders before firing past Manuel Neuer.

Bayern equalized shortly after the break through Robert Lewandowski, but they were unable to build on their momentum and Dortmund sealed the win late on through Marco Reus.

It was a deserved victory for Dortmund, who showed greater urgency and attacking intent than their opponents and now move three points clear at the top of the Bundesliga table.

#  Lewandowski Fires Dortmund To Victory Over Bayern In Dramatic Encounter

In a potentially title-deciding game at the Westfalenstadion, Borussia Dortmund recorded a resounding 4-2 victory over Bayern Munich.

Dortmund started brightly and took the lead in the 20th minute when Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang tapped home from close range after some good work from Ousmane Dembélé.

Bayern equalised just before halftime when Arturo Vidal headed home from a corner, but Dortmund restored their lead early in the second half when Sokratis Papastathopoulos scored with a well-placed header.

The hosts extended their lead shortly afterwards when Lewandowski volleyed in a superb goal, and although Thomas Müller pulled one back for Bayern with a deflected effort, Dembélé sealed the win for Dortmund with a cool finish in injury time.

The result means that Dortmund now move level on points with Bayern at the top of the Bundesliga table, while nearest rivals RB Leipzig are four points behind.

#  Arsenal, Dortmund Battle It Out In A Thrilling Europa League Encounter

The first leg of the Europa League quarterfinals saw Arsenal and Dortmund face off in an extremely thrilling encounter. The two sides produced some scintillating attacking football, with both teams having chances to win the game. Ultimately, the match finished in a draw with both clubs taking a share of the spoils.

Arsenal started the game brightly, and they looked like they were going to take an early lead when Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's effort hit the post. However, Dortmund soon settled into the game and they started to create chances of their own. The best chance of the first half fell to Shinji Kagawa, but his effort was brilliantly saved by Arsenal goalkeeper Petr Cech.

The second half was just as entertaining as the first, with both teams carving out chances. The best chance of the second half came to Andy Weidenfeller, but he couldn't keep his header down. Arsenal had a few good chances to win it late on, but they couldn't find a way past Weidenfeller. In the end, both teams had to be content with a draw.

It was an excellent performance from both sides and it sets up a mouth-watering return leg next Thursday. Dortmund will be favourites to progress given that they are at home in the second leg, but Arsenal will certainly not be given up without a fight.
