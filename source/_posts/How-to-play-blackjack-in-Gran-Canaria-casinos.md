So, here's a quick guide to some of the most popular table games at casinos in Gran Canaria and how to play them.

# Blackjack

Blackjack is one of the most popular table games in the world, and it's easy to see why. It's simple to learn but has enough strategy to keep things interesting. In blackjack, players are trying to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 as possible without going over. Face cards (Kings, Queens, and Jacks) are worth 10 points each, and other cards are worth their face value. A player can either hit (take another card) or stand (stick with what they have). If a player goes over 21, they bust and lose automatically. The dealer also takes another card at 17.

# Roulette

Roulette is another classic casino game that's been around for centuries. In roulette, players bet on where they think the ball will land after spinning around a wheel with 36 numbered pockets and 18 red and 18 black slots. There are a variety of bets you can make, including betting on a single number, betting on two numbers (split), betting on three numbers (street), betting on four numbers (corner), or betting on six numbers (line). The odds vary depending on which bet you make, but the house edge is generally around 2%.

# Poker

Poker is one of the more complex table games, but it's also one of the most popular. In poker, players are competing against each other for the best hand. There are many variations of poker, but most variants involve players being dealt five cards face down. They then have the opportunity to either hold all five cards (called Texas Hold'em), discard some and replace them with new ones from the deck (called draw poker), or replace none of them and just go with what they have (called stud poker). After everyone has had their turn, the highest hand wins the pot.
