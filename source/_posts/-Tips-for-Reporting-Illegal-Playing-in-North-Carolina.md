#   Tips for Reporting Illegal Playing in North Carolina

Illegal gambling, commonly called “playing the numbers” or simply “playing,” is a misdemeanor crime in North Carolina. Gambling generally refers to risking something of value on the outcome of an event that is not determined by chance.

Section 14-292 of the North Carolina General Statutes makes it a Class 2 misdemeanor to engage in gambling. This criminal law prohibits playing any game or going to any place for the purpose of gambling. The statute specifically includes state lottery tickets and other investments as being within the prohibition against gambling.

# What is Considered Illegal Gambling?

In order for an act or transaction to be considered illegal gambling under North Carolina law, it must meet three elements: 
1) chance; 
2) money or something else of value risked; and 
3) a prize. Therefore, most contests or games that use skill are not considered gambling under the law even if money or other valuable items are wagered on the outcome.

For example, a basketball game between friends would not be illegal gambling even if one person betting another person $10 that their team would win. However, buying a state lottery ticket would be considered illegal gambling because chance is a significant element in determining the winner. Placing a bet with a bookie would also be illegal gambling because money is risked on the outcome of an event taking place outside of the bettor’s control.

Another sign that someone might be illegally playing is when they refuse to show their cards. This could be a sign that they're trying to hide something, and it's important to be suspicious of anyone who won't let you see their hand.

If you see someone trying to stack the deck in their favor, this is another sign that they might be illegally playing. This could include things like switching cards or manipulating the dice. If you see anything like this happening, it's best to end the game and leave.
