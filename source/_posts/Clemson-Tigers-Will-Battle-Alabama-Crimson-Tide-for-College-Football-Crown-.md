#  Clemson Tigers Will Battle Alabama Crimson Tide for College Football Crown 

The 2017 college football season is winding down, and the biggest game of the year is just around the corner. The Clemson Tigers will take on the Alabama Crimson Tide in a rematch of last year’s National Championship game.

Alabama enters this game as a 7-point favorite, but Clemson is not afraid of them. The Tigers have arguably the best quarterback in the country in Deshaun Watson, and they also have an excellent defense.

Alabama has been dominant all season long, and they certainly have the edge in terms of talent. But Clemson has proved that they can compete with anyone, and they will not be intimidated by Alabama.

The Tigers are coming into this game with a lot of momentum, and they are looking to bring home the championship trophy. They have already beaten some of the best teams in the country this season, including Auburn and Louisville.

Alabama is certainly not invincible, and Clemson has a very good chance of pulling off an upset. This should be an exciting game to watch, and it is sure to produce plenty of fireworks.

#  Clemson Looks to End Alabama's Dominance in College Football 

It has been a long time since a team has been able to unseat Alabama from their throne in college football. But this year, Clemson is looking to do just that.

With one of the most dominant offences in the country and a defence that is finally starting to come together, the Tigers look like they could be the team to finally take down the Tide.

Alabama has been absolutely dominant in recent years, but there are some weaknesses in their game that Clemson can exploit. The Crimson Tide have had trouble defending against dual-threat quarterbacks, and Clemson's Deshaun Watson is one of the best in the country.

Alabama's offensive line is also not as strong as it has been in past years, and Clemson's defensive line is one of the best in the country. If they can get pressure on Alabama's quarterback Jalen Hurts, they will have a chance to win this game.

All eyes will be on Clemson and Alabama when they face off on January 9th. It should be an epic battle, and it is sure to be one of the most watched games of the year.

#  Online Sportsbooks Predict Clemson Victors over Alabama 

Online sportsbooks have released their odds for the upcoming college football championship game, and Clemson is the favorite.

Clemson is a 2.5-point favorite over Alabama, with an over/under of 57 points. The Crimson Tide are coming off of a last-second 26-23 victory over Georgia in the SEC Championship Game, while Clemson defeated Notre Dame 30-3 in the ACC Championship Game.

Alabama coach Nick Saban has been outspoken about his team's lack of preparation heading into the title game. "I think our team wasn't really happy with how they played last week," Saban said on Monday. "I don't think we had a lot of respect for the other team."

Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence was injured in the first quarter of the ACC Championship Game but returned to lead Clemson to a victory. "He was cleared to play and there was never any question in his mind that he was going to play," Clemson coach Dabo Swinney said on Monday. "He just wanted to make sure that he was good enough to help us win."

Both teams are led by impressive sophomore quarterbacks, with Lawrence facing off against Alabama's Tua Tagovailoa. Tagovailoa is coming off a Sugar Bowl performance in which he passed for 462 yards and five touchdowns in a 45-34 victory over Oklahoma.

"It will be interesting to see how they matchup," ESPN analyst Kirk Herbstreit said of Lawrence and Tagovailoa. "Trevor has been playing really well since he's come back from injury. I'm anxious to see those two go at it."
